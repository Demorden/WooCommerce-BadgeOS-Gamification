# WooCommerce-BadgeOS-Gamification
This simple plugin links products with badges; you can now grant BadgeOS achievements based on purchases.

The code is VERY simple, but it works. :)

## Example workflow:
- Create Woocommerce product, say "EXAMPLEPRODUCT"
- Create BadgeOS badge, e.g. "EXAMPLEBADGE"
- Write down your new badge ID
- Go back to the product, look for the "Achievement Granted" option, paste the ID
- Now, whenever a user will buy "EXAMPLEPRODUCT", they will be awarded "EXAMPLEBADGE"

Good for those sites that want/need to show users' purchases for gamification or marketing purposes.

**DO NOT use this for sensitive or embarassing stuff, like if you have an adult toys store! :D**

### Note to users:
This plugin JUST links products with badges, with the logic "IF BUY THIS PRODUCT, GET THAT BADGE".
All other options for products and badges will be available.
